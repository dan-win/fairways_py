flatten chain sequence as array? (recursion vs iteration, see: https://www.quora.com/In-Python-which-is-more-efficient-to-use-recursion-or-iteration)
middleware <--- as chain + decorators
trigger chains via Event or Queue, not include???

Chains: additional methods like .on, .when, .join, .merge can be constructed combining "middleware. Try to avoid nested calls (!)

Chains as "lazy" computations. 


asyncmethod decorators - handle exceptions inside decorated func!

"features", "flavors" - separate dependencies from 3rd-party packs (redis, ...)


Query.get_records - method which always returns list or raises error
Query.get_response - mode generic method, returns named tuple {response, error, data - list or object}
TRANSPORT MEDIA MESSAGE SHOULD BE ONE TYPE FOR ALL TRANSPORTS!
class Message:
    result
    error
    payload
Chains: move Failure state from step into message?
Chains should be last - it builds array of deferred methods,
where result computed only after consumption. override right equal __eq.....???
