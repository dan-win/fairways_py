flatten chain sequence as array? (recursion vs iteration, see: https://www.quora.com/In-Python-which-is-more-efficient-to-use-recursion-or-iteration)
middleware <--- as chain + decorators
trigger chains via Event or Queue, not include???

Chains: additional methods like .on, .when, .join, .merge can be constructed combining "middleware. Try to avoid nested calls (!)

Chains as "lazy" computations. 


asyncmethod decorators - handle exceptions inside decorated func!

"features", "flavors" - separate dependencies from 3rd-party packs (redis, ...)
